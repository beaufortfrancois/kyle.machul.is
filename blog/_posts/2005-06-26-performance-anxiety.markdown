Ugh. Can't sleep, research paper will eat me.

Lately, I've been feeling like it's time to figure out what I wanna do when I grow up, since I can only put off growing up a couple of more years before I switch from being "curious youth" to "listless bum". 

Working on robotics is cool. Really cool. I'd be happy to do it for the rest of my life. Unfortunatly, working at the Institute isn't exactly bringing in bags o' cash, 'cause, well, by definition, there can't legally be bags of cash just lying around to take (stupid non-profitness). In the US, this leaves me 3 choices. Space, Military, or Something Else. 

I've tried Space, and I didn't like it very much. NASA was cool and all, but I don't know if lobbing shit at other planets is really what I want to do with my life.

Military is a HELL FUCKING NO right from the start. I don't mind bruising the moon with a rover, but having to write the decision chain that seperates school bus from tank? No thank you. I already have enough of a problem sleeping at night as is.

That leaves us with Something Else. Right now, there's not a lot of Something Else available in the US. You've got iRobot, and... iRobot. All they're looking for right now is PackBot people, and I covered that issue in the last paragraph. However hard I try, I cannot seem to become Japanese (the instructions in the song totally don't work), which rules out being able to work on all the neat assistive stuff going on in Japan right now. 

I'm thinking about grad school right now, but I'm not sure where I'd go. I've got my eye on two different programs right now. First, there's the Robotics masters program at CMU. Assuming I wanted to keep up robotics, that'd be the obvious place to go. Not to mention, one of the profs I like a lot (Illah Nourbakhsh) is heading up the program there now. A robotics degree is somewhat less pigeonholing than, say, a game design/development degree, but it's still a pretty narrow field.

Lately, I've also been looking at possibly going into new media and interactive/immersive environment design. Other than the fact that I railed against this stuff in college 'cause I was a little elitest CS bastard who thought UI was useless (I actually once said "Screw people! I don't write programs for people!"), but after starting Slashdong (and having a ridiculous interest in sociology and group interaction throughout college), the whole aspect of human interactivity through computers has become a horribly interesting subject to me. NYU offers a masters in <A HREF='http://itp.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home'>"Interactive Telecommunications"</A> that I'm really thinking about applying for. It seems like it's the combination of exactly what I'm looking for: human sociology and interaction with enough engineering thrown in to keep my computery side happy. However, the pigeonholing aspect of this degree is worse than pretty much anything else I can think of.

Unfortunatly, I'm hitting a serious doubt wall on both of these paths right now. In robotics, I feel like I'm way, way, way behind everyone else in the field. I came out of OU knowing nothing (and I mean NOTHING) but software. I've taught myself quite a bit over the past 2 1/2 years, but now I feel like I only know enough to bluff my way through a conversation. I have a very insane fear that since I didn't learn any of this stuff academically, I'm doing something fundamentally WRONG, and no one is noticing or telling me. Of course, I figure I would've like, lost my job or cut off a limb or something had that actually happened (and I *have* done stuff wrong and had people tell me, i.e. the control system on the first rover). But irrational fears aren't that easy to logic out.

With the Interactive Telecommunications stuff, well, that's sort of a "stranger in a strange land" type deal. I've never really been very artistic, but I get a lot of comments that I think in "big picture" terms very well, which seems like it would fit with this degree. I'm even working on a research paper for a UI/Design conference at the moment, but it's hell to actually write the thing because of the massive fear of rejection I've got at the moment. Having just participated in writing a small part of my first published research paper, and realizing how little of a clue I had on how to do that, I'm scared to hell of trying to go it on my own. Sure, it doesn't cost anything, it's a learning experience, and everyone I've talked to about the idea loves it, but once again, fucking irrational fear.

Combine this with having to deal with moving, and I'm a god damn basket case at the moment. Someone come make my decisions for me, or at least bash my skull in so I can stop thinking about stuff and just do what makes me happy. Why does thinking have to interfere with shit so damn much?
