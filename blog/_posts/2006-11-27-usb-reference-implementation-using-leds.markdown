Weekend project, while not quite as done as I wanted it to be, was still a success!<br />
<br />
Made a USB reference implementation using the <A HREF='http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/'>USBTiny</A> firmware only USB 1.1 Low-Speed driver. Haven't actually gotten to do much with it outside of putting the board together and running a couple of python (which I'm learning to love quickly) test scripts. Still, it's nice to have some sort of USB connection without having to go through FDTI, though I suppose I could always do something zany like move to a decent, higher speed 32-bit platform too. But for now, this works.
