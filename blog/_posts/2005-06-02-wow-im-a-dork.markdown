So for all of you who arn't hip to the life of qDot, I maintain a compiler known as <A HREF='http://www.botball.org/ic'>Interactive C</A>. Basically, it's a version of C that's interactive. You can upload arrays created by IC and stored in memory in order to do data analysis.

Anyways, just got a bug report from a user:

User: 

<i>"When you attempt to upload an array when the Handyboard is not actually plugged in IC crashes." </i>

My Reply: 

<i>"If you have a v1.2 HB, simply put the HB on top of the computer and try to download. We implemented array upload through osmotic transfer in 5.05.

Please note, this will only work with a water cooled computer."</i>

So yeah, I know the guy, but I'm seriously hoping he doesn't pass that around, otherwise we're gonna start getting some REALLY weird support calls at the institute.
