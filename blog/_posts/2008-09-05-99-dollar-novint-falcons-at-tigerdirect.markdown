<A HREF='http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3427255&sku=N128-1000&srkey=novint%20falcon'>Tiger Direct now has the Novint Falcon for $99</A>. Only took a little over a year from release for the price to finally drop to the <$100 level they promised 2 years before launch. :D

So, if you had interest in helping out with the <A HREF='http://libnifalcon.sourceforge.net'>LibNIFalcon project</A> but didn't want to throw the cash down, well, now it's less cash to throw down. LibNIF is cranking right along, the C++ version is nearing the first milestone, and we've now got what will hopefully be a much more stable kinematics model in the works.
