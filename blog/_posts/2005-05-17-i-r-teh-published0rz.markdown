Yay! Academic legitimacy is mine! ALL MINE!

I got a paper on Lunar Rover Telecommunication published at <A HREF='http://www.congrex.nl/05a02/'>iSAIRAS</A>, and a paper on the XBC (the XBC is the gameboy robot we'll soon be selling at KIPR) published at <A HREF='http://www.iros2005.org/'>IROS</A>! 

Yaaaaay!

(Note, I was not the only author on either of these papers, but who cares MEMEMEMEMEMEME! =D )

I think this may very well drive my <A HREF='http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ErdosNumber.html'>Erdos number</a> under infinity!
