I created this back in September, when I was taking my Max/MSP classes at <A HREF='http://www.robotspeak.com'>RobotSpeak</A>. I decided to try layering <A HREF='http://www.twitter.com'>twitter</A> public timeline messages run through text-to-speech over fairly simple looped break samples, because noise + noise = noise.

Unfortunately, either Py/Ext or flite~ is causing Max/MSP to crash about 20-30 minutes in, regularly, so having a full time stream running is a bit of an issue right now. However, I made a small 2.5 minute track.
