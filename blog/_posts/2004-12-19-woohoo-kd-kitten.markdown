I made the <A HREF='http://katamaridamacy.jp/download/index_e.html#craft'>Katamari Damacy paper cat</A>, and <A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=kdcat'>documented the process.</A>

Why? I have no idea. I just kept getting gigglefits at the half finished paper kitten and decided it needed pictures. 

This is what I do with my spare time.
