<A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com'>Numberporn</A> and <A HREF='http://www.deathbots.com'>Deathbots</A> are done! Wheee, only 3 sites left to build from the ground up! 

I finally finished <A HREF='http://www.deathbots.com'>Deathbots</A>, my robotics projects page, so it's time for the shameless self-plug. Currently, I'm working on 4 different projects.

Table Tennis Robot - These usually cost around $2000 for one of decent quality. That's just ridiculous. I can *easily* build one that will cost $4000, minimum. The weird thing is, I havn't found one that hooks into a computer yet, or does any sort of shot analysis/pattern training/anything halfway interesting that could easily be done with current technology.

Assisted Living Tank - We've got a bunch of electric auto-stablizing wheelchairs (or, well, tread-chairs, as they actually run on large treads) sitting around the office. I'm planning on replacing the internal electronics (all of which are currently circa 1988, meaning 4 huge circuit boards will be replaces with one small chip. :) ), and then doing things that one would do if they had their own personal tank base. Like dressing up as the first level boss from SmashTV for Halloween! (picture below for those of you not familiar with the game)

Robosapien Hacking - I can't believe no one has turned their Robosapien in to a Gir yet! It's the perfect Gir platform! So I'm doing it, along with turning it into a Domokun, and putting other cute outfits on it. There's also this whole thing about making it into a walking robotics platform with the xport board blahblahblah who cares <B>CUTENESS</B>!

Trikebot Hacking - I've gotta find something interesting to do with Trikebot, other than dressing him up in cute outfits. Though there's nothing wrong with that. 

Pictures and articles of the beginnings of these projects are now up and available on the page.

There's going to be a webcomic as soon as I get over my absolute fear of putting shit I draw up onto the net. I'm very, very self-concious about my creative outlets for some reason, but I'll grow some balls and get over it in the next couple of weeks, I'm sure. I'm also trying to get enough stuff drawn ahead so that if I hit a block, I can have a few weeks of already finished stuff to catch up.

I'll be happy to give out space if anyone has robotics/electronics projects they'd like to have web hosting for, lord knows I've got way more resources on my dreamhost account than I'll ever be able to use by myself. 

So go! Look! Sign up on the forums! Help out! Yay!
