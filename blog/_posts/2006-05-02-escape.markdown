Well, everything is signed and done and all that. 

Fuck you, Oklahoma, I'm off to San Francisco!

I'm goin' to work for <A HREF='http://www.lindenlab.com'>Linden Lab</A>, makers of the <A HREF='http://www.secondlife.com'>Second Life</A> thing I tend to talk about when I actually have time to log on (which hasn't been any time in the past 2 months).

Moving in early-mid June, so if you're in Oklahoma and want one last chance to bask in the greatness that is me, you better start queuein' up. I've only got so much time for the little people now that I'm movin' out to the real world.
