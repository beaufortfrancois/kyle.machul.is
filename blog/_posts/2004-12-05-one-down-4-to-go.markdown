<A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com/'>Numberporn is done!</A>

I finally finished my redo of my personal domain. There's not much on it, but it's done. 

The header menu used to be written in PHP. All of the menu generation math was hand written. Since then, CSS has gotten a lot better, so I just took an hour and rewrote it. I think it took me a week to get the PHP menu written when I did it. Yay for upgraded technology!

I also upgraded <A HREF='http://www.movabletype.org'>MovableType</A>, and added autoupdating lists for <A HREF='http://www.audioscrobbler.com'>Audioscrobbler</A> and <A HREF='http://del.icio.us'>Del.Icio.Us</A>, so now you can always know what I'm listening to and what pages I think are spiffy. It's almost kinda stalkerish and creepy, ain't it?

Finally, I put a <A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com/gallery'>photo gallery</A> up, containing pictures from my trip to Chicago (which I already posted about), as well as pictures of a younger, horribly less fashion concious me. And, most importantly, pictures of kittens. LOTS of kittens.

This week, I bought <A HREF='http://www.nonpolynomial.com'>nonpolynomial.com</A>, since it's kinda hard to do public releases of projects under the numberporn name (though that hasn't stopped me as of yet :) ). I picked up iahacking.com too, which I'll be moving <A HREF='http://www.ia1hacking.com'>ia1hacking.com</A> over to when I get to that. 

On to finishing <A HREF='http://www.deathbots.com'>Deathbots</A>, which doesn't have much left to do on it.
