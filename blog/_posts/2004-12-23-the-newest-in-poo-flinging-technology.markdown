For those of you not aware, I'm working on building my own table tennis bot right now (project documented <A HREF='http://www.deathbots.com/boards/index.php?c=3'>here</A>). I was doing some research on other bots out at the moment, and found this one, newly released this month.<BR>
Now, is it just me, or does the ball hopper look like a toilet? I mean, really, it looks like you'd poo, then run away as it threw your own poo back at you. Strangely artistic in some sort of dadaist way.<BR>
