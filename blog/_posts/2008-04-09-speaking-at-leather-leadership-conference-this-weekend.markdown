Yup, it took all of a month for my "no new speaking until I have something new to say" thing to fall apart. But, well, this is different! Really! Somehow. :)

So yeah, I'm now part of the BDSM and Web 2.0 panel at <A HREF='http://loc.leatherleadership.org/llc12/index.html'>the 12th Annual Leather Leadership Conference</A>. The panel takes place Sunday, April 13th, at 10:30am. The panel will include Thomas Roche (who I was also on a panel with at Arse Elektronika, now of <A HREF='http://www.kink.com'>kink.com</A>), Richard Hunter (of <A HREF='http://www.mr-s-leather.com'>Mr. S Leather</A>), Steve Bower (Webmaster for the <A HREF='http://www.soj.org/main.html'>Society of Janus</A>),  and others. Should be fun!
