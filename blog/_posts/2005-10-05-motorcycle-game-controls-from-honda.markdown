Honda has released a control setup specifically for motorcycle gaming. With a seat resembling one you'd normally seeon the vehicle, and a realistic handbar setup, motorcycle racers and paper boys (this thing just screams for pedals to turn it into a BMX sim. :) )  alike can now immerse themselves in computer racing simulations.

Wish we could get one of these for the LifeCycle Project.
