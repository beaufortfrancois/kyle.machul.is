Ever have a delayed AH-HA? (for those that never took classes with Dr. Varahan at OU, this means pretty much means coming to understand something years after it was originally presented to you)

In my software engineering course during college, our professor was deeply, passionately in love with Haskell. None of us could figure out why. Of course, researching the language would mean doing work outside of class, and well, fuck that.

So I was reading [Lambda The Ultimate][1] today, and someone posted a ["Haskell for C/C++ Programmers" tutorial][2].

Holy fuck, was I ever missing out. This is some sexy, sexy shit.
