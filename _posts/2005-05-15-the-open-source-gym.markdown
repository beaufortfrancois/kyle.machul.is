[The Open Source Gym Project][1]

<div class='PostIcon' markdown='1'>[![][2]][1]</div>

So it's not exactly about robots, yet, but I don't want to start yet another domain for just one project, so it's on here.

The Open Source Gym is my way of trying to get myself interested in actually using all of the exercise equipment currently collecting dust in my living room. By hooking up exercise equipment to the [Xport][3], and programming applications to track history and improvement, I should be able to generate enough infoporn to make me keep a good schedule. I'm also working on exercise equipment as video game controllers, which has been tried before, but never with any real success in the commerical realm. 

I've already got my exercise bike up and running on the system, as well as controlling a very stripped down, "proof of concept" (read: full of bugs and sphgetti code) version of a Nibbles/Snake game. I plan on getting the treadmill on the system soon, as well as fleshing out a more serious development framework to start making new applications under.

Oh yeah, and maybe I'll exercise now, too.
