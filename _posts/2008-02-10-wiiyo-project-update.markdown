Well, I finally got new LEDs in, thanks to the nice people at <A HREF='http://www.rentron.com'>Renoylds Electronics</A>, who shipped another batch of LEDs after the first got lost in transit. I replaced the LEDs currently on the yoyo with <A HREF='http://www.rentron.com/remote_control/IRLED.htm#1L2'>OED-EL-1L2s</A>, which have a 60 degree beam angle. This seems to have made a ton of difference, as the drawing program now makes tricks identifiable, especially with the scribbles where hold points are.

For instance, a sleeper:

And a trapeze:

Next step is getting all of this out of Max/MSP and into either <A HREF='http://puredata.info'>PD</A> or <A HREF='http://www.openframeworks.cc'>OpenFrameworks</A>, as my Max demo license ran out and I'm not throwin' down the cash until they finally announce their pricing scheme for Max 5.
