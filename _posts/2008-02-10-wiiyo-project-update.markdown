Well, I finally got new LEDs in, thanks to the nice people at [Renoylds Electronics][1], who shipped another batch of LEDs after the first got lost in transit. I replaced the LEDs currently on the yoyo with [OED-EL-1L2s][2], which have a 60 degree beam angle. This seems to have made a ton of difference, as the drawing program now makes tricks identifiable, especially with the scribbles where hold points are.

For instance, a sleeper:

And a trapeze:

Next step is getting all of this out of Max/MSP and into either [PD][7] or [OpenFrameworks][8], as my Max demo license ran out and I'm not throwin' down the cash until they finally announce their pricing scheme for Max 5.
