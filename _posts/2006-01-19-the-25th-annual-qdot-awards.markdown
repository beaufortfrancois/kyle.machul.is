Best qDot Project of 2005:

Hooky/The Lifecycle

Reason: Yeah, I bet you were expecting the SeXBox. When you look back on it, come on. I put a motor in place of a motor. That's not exactly breakthrough engineering there. The Lifecycle is a hell of a lot more useful to people, it just didn't get the same attention because there wasn't a dildo involved.

Honorable Mention: Tie: Slashdong, MMOrgy, The SexBox.
