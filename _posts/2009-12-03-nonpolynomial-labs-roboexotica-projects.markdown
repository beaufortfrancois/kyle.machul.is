For the past month, I've been living in Vienna as part of as artist residency with [monochrom][1]. The main goal of this residency was to complete some projects for [roboexotica][2], the robotics cocktail party held each year here in Vienna. This year, [roboexotica][2] is being held December 3-6, and now that I've actually seen my projects pour some drinks, I figured it's time to present them to the world.

First off, there's Adult Mario, the mario game that drinks and vibrates!

Then there's Bartris, the tetris that's also a bartender.

I'll have a post next week that goes into the implementation specifics of these projects, but for now, all of the code is available at [http://www.github.com/qdot/bartris][3].
