It's been a while since I've started up a new website, and I found
myself doing enough work on health hardware that I decided to spin it
out into its own site. Not to mention, there's already a ton of
drivers and software out there, but there's been no central place to
record it thus far. [openyou.org][1] will feature posts about open
source health technology, as well as information on library and driver
projects to give developers and users new ways to learn about
themselves via code. 

Hopefully I manage to keep it up a little better than I have here and
[slashdong][2] lately, too.
