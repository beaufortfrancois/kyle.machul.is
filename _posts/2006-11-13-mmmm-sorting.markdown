I was totally planning on getting something done on SOME project today, but instead worked on sorting all of my hardware into the new drawer units I got. I'm not even 20% done yet and I've already put hours into it, but I've also found some actually useful stuff (I will be stocked on 47 uF radial electrolytic capacitors until the end of time. They may become christmas presents this year.)
