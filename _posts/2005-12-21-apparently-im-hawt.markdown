Wheeee! I'm one of <A HREF='http://www.tinynibbles.com/blogarchives/2005/12/top_ten_sexiest.html'>the top ten sexiest geeks of 2005</A> according to <A HREF='http://www.tinynibbles.com'>Violet Blue</A>, and if anyone knows geeks and sexy, it's her.

So, for those of you that knew me when I looked like <A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com/gallery/TheYoungqDot01/kyle2'>this</A> or <A HREF='http://www.numberporn.com/gallery/TheYoungqDot/kyle21'>this</A> (for reference, <A HREF='http://www.flickr.com/photos/80226255@N00/73357881/'>I now look like this</A>), well, now I can say more than "at least my mom thinks I'm cool".
