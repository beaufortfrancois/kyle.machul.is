So I took the day off of work today, mostly because I REALLY needed some quiet time to myself, but I've also decided to restart all of my websites again, and I figured today was the day to do that.

I haven't posted on or really done much of anything with my websites for over a year now, if not more on some. My usual website development process looks something like this. I buy domain name I think is neat.

Two choices at this point. It can either sit there and do nothing, something like [The Dong][1] has been doing since I bought it last December. Otherwise, I'll actually work on stuff, but will forget about it at some point, it will lose all popularity it once had, and will end up being very broken when I get back to it, so much so that I don't want to work on it anymore. Such has been the fate of every single website I have ever owned. 

Now, I've been in the webpage game since 1995, when "MAGE'S WWW PAGE" first came up on our local dialup ISPs webserver with crappy backgrounds and the MANDATORY drippy bloodbars. Here's a quick chronology of what I've done since then:

* 1994 - Pick up the nick DGMage from an AOL warez group I was in (DG0+41< FOREVAH.). Used to be just Mage before that. Why? I dunno.

* 1995 - http://www.galstar.net/~mage/ (dead) - First page on galstar. I can't even remember what this had on it anymore, though there might be some bits of it left on backup tapes I have here that I'm sure I'll never get to restoring. Also started on IRC sometime this year, first in #gothcafe, then on over to #gothic.

* 1996 - http://www.ionet.net/~mage/ (dead, no archive.com links) Move to ionet.net, 'cause galstar died a much deserved death. This was the year I started Bored Goth Central, which was to be the hub of all of my projects for the next few years. This page is where the Gothic Scouts started, probably what I was (unfortunatly) most known for, and that just recently seems to have died, but I'll get to that later.

* 1997 - [http://www.gothic.net/~mage/][2] (dead, link to archive.com database) - The big move to gothic.net, and probably the most popularity BGC ever enjoyed. 2500+ members on the Gothic Scouts, almost got on the Daily Show, got mentions on various TV shows and in magazines. Good times for my egotistical 17 year old ass.

* 1998 - [http://www.gothicscouts.com][3] - Dropped off of gothic.net after various events, took gothicscouts to its own domain, killed the rest of BGC. Went to college, pages start becoming less and less important as college becomes more and more... Ah, who the hell am I kidding, I was starting to grow out of the whole goth thing and totally didn't want to admit it yet.

* 2001 - [Numberporn Lives][4] - Bought numberporn.com in 2001 because it seemed like a funny name, and I needed a webpage of my own. Didn't actually do anything with it until 2002.

* 2002 - On my 22nd birthday, drop the DGMage nick, and am now the qDot everyone today knows and loves and hopefully doesn't relate to the DGMage nick. Also hand off the gothic scouts to some other people, nothing much ever happens to it, at least that I'm aware of, I totally stopped paying attention.

* 2003 - Start at new job, do lots of web work that I really don't want to be doing but got myself into anyways because I wasn't exactly realizing what I was doing, learn to hate everything about the web, PHP, etc... Totally burn out on web pages, never want to see them again. Pick up an LJ because it seems like little work for decent reward (i.e. people might actually read it). All actual pages fall into extreme state of disrepair

* 2004 - Decide to get over burnout, which is a lot easier since I havn't had to touch web stuff in close to a year now. Gothicscouts.com dies because I didn't even realize it needed to be renewed.

That puts us where we are today. Right now, I own 5 domains. Here's where they currently are, and where I'd like to see them.

* [Numberporn][5]

  * Currently - This is what you're reading right now, and there ain't a goddamn thing here. Just the movabletype front page, and that's *it*.

  * Plans - I'll have my personal blog here still, as well as any other funny/stupid projects I think up. I'll also host my photo gallery and forums from here. Basically, it'll be a homepage. Nothing special.

* [DeathBots][6]

  * Currently - Just a filler page, I only bought the domain a couple of weeks ago.

  * Plans - This will be my robotics domain. Thanks to the job, it looks like I'm gonna be doin' this robotics thing for a good long time to come, so I figure I might as well start a page about it. My robotics posts on LJ have led me to meet a lot of really interesting and cool people, and I've now got personal projects that I'd like to document on the web.

* [IA-1 Hacking][7]

  * Currently - Still gets the most hits of any of my domains, at least 50-100 uniques per day. This domain was for information on hacking the Compaq IA-1, a pretty damn useless IA (Internet Appliance) with a fairly high learning curve for hacking. It came with MSN support but MSN dropped it as of last August, so now the machines either have to be hacked, or else they're pretty much pieces of junk

  * Plans - I'd like to turn this into a general IA hacking site, since I've got one major application I'm working on for IA's, and since I own more than just the IA-1, I figure I could provide info for all of them. Nothing spectacular, as a lot of them have their own sites ([http://www.audreyhacking.com/][8] and [http://www.linux-hacker.net][9] are two of the larger ones), but there's not really anything out there that tells people *why* they should hack an IA, other than for the sheer satisfaction of doing it and having and extra 10" LCD screen around to play with.

* [Knot Theory][10]

  * Currently - I made this as a yoyo trick search site, and it even has a sort of half-assed search engine going right now. I'm pretty sure very little of the site still works, however.

  * Plans - Rewrite the search engine and host it offsite on a server that will support PostgreSQL. As for the rest of the site, turn the front page back into the yoyo blog it was supposed to be in the first place, maybe work on the trick simulator I always talked about.

* [Slashdong][11]

  * Currently - Filler page that's been there since last December.

  * Plans - Oh boy. Oooooooooooooh boy. I think all I can say is this: **NSFW**.

So what's the major difference this time? What's the thing that's hopefully going to keep all these pages going, unlike the last many, many times I've tried this? 

I think it's pretty simple. This time, nothing that I write will be dynamic (outside of the knot-theory.com search engine, but that's a different story). In every single one of my webpages before this, I wrote everything from the ground up. There was horribly complicated content management systems behind everything, most of which didn't need it. Of course, my goal was to learn php and SQL, and I did that. Now I'm knowledgable enough about them to know that I'd really not like to have to work with them at all if I have to, but I can fix stuff if it goes wrong. Otherwise, if I need a gallery, I'll use a prebuilt one. Blog, message boards, content management, everything will be prebuilt, because I don't have want or time to remake any more wheels. 

So far, it seems to be going pretty well. I've got MovableType talking to LJ, I've got gallery up and running, and I'm about to kill InvisionBoard and put up a PHPBB. Then I can actually work on content of all the sites, instead of writing out a base object tree for all of their content to be generated out of.

Yup, it's nothing but CSS and HTML for me now. This time, I'm not a web developer, I don't want to be a web developer. I just want to design, put stuff up, and go on with the interesting projects that I'm documenting. Hopefully, it'll stay that way too.
