I'll be speaking at South by Southwest Interactive, on the "Secret Sex Lives of Video Games" Panel on Tuesday, March 14th.

Panel Participants

Tony Walsh - [ClickableCulture][3]

Glennis McClellan - [Republik Games][4]

Julianne Greer - [The Escapist][5]

Mark Wallache - [Walkering.com][6]/[Second Life Herald][7]

Kyle Machulis (aka qDot, aka qDot Bunnyhug, aka ME) - [Nonpolynomial Labs][8]/[IGDA Sex In Games SIG][9]/[Slashdong.org][10]/[MMOrgy.com][11]

Come see us try and discuss emergent sex in video games in a vaguely academic way until we all break down and just start saying naughty words just because we can. I do so love talking about this stuff.
