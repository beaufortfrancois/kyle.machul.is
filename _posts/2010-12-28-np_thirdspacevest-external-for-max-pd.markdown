As of last night, I got Windows, OS X, and Linux support working on
the C version of [libthirdspacevest][1] for the
[The TN Games Third Space Vest][2], so now it seemed like a good idea
to do my usual followup and make a [Max/MSP][3] and [PureData][4]
external for it. So, there's now a [np_thirdspacevest][5] repo, and
[matching binary distribution site on sourceforge][6]. I've just
released version 0.1, the source code and Max 5 external are on
sourceforge. Will build more externals as I need them or as I get
demand, but, well, I've managed to go from getting hardware to full
cross platform drivers and libraries for 3 languages in the span of a
week, so I'm just gonna sit here and feel proud of myself for the
moment.
