Well, after two months of not getting much done I finally manage to zip a directory and call it v0.4 of <A HREF='http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libnifalcon'>libnifalcon</A>, and the developer responsible for the <A HREF='http://www.nonpolynomial.com/archives/2008/05/solidedge-simulation-of-the-novint-falco.php'>SolidEdge simulation</A> <A HREF='http://picasaweb.google.com/kouellet/FalconProject?authkey=kAvHYd9lo5A'>does a full uncasing of the Falcon, taking a great picture set along the way</A>. I'm start to feel like I'm falling a bit behind in usefulness here. :)

I really like this image for some reason.
