When the belly starts a rumbling and I'm jonesing for a treat,

I close my eyes for a big surprise the [tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch][1]

I love [tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch][1] - the breasts they grown on trees

and streams of bacon ranch dressing flow right up to your knees

there's tumbleweeds of bacon and cheddar paves the streets

folks don't fudge it cause you got the juice - there's a train of ladies coming with a nice caboose

never get in trouble, never need an excuse

that's the [tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch][1]

I love the [tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch][1] no one tells you to behave

your wildest fantasies come true - Dallas cheerleaders give you shaves

where onions make you laugh instead and french fries grow like weeds

You get to veg all day, all the lotto tickets paid,

there's a king that wants you to have it your way,

that's the [tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch][1].

Cooooome aaaaand get it!
