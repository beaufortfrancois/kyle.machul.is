When the belly starts a rumbling and I'm jonesing for a treat,
I close my eyes for a big surprise the <A HREF='http://www.unc.edu/~brianz/tendercrispbaconcheddarranch.html'>tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch</A>
I love <A HREF='http://www.unc.edu/~brianz/tendercrispbaconcheddarranch.html'>tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch</A> - the breasts they grown on trees
and streams of bacon ranch dressing flow right up to your knees
there's tumbleweeds of bacon and cheddar paves the streets
folks don't fudge it cause you got the juice - there's a train of ladies coming with a nice caboose
never get in trouble, never need an excuse
that's the <A HREF='http://www.unc.edu/~brianz/tendercrispbaconcheddarranch.html'>tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch</A>
I love the <A HREF='http://www.unc.edu/~brianz/tendercrispbaconcheddarranch.html'>tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch</A> no one tells you to behave
your wildest fantasies come true - Dallas cheerleaders give you shaves
where onions make you laugh instead and french fries grow like weeds
You get to veg all day, all the lotto tickets paid,
there's a king that wants you to have it your way,
that's the <A HREF='http://www.unc.edu/~brianz/tendercrispbaconcheddarranch.html'>tender crisp bacon cheddar ranch</A>.
