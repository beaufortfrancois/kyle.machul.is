Was talking to the guy who's starting <A HREF='http://www.yoyodb.com'>yoyodb</A>, a new yoyo trick linking site (Ok, so I was bullying him to make sure he wasn't doing an exact copy of <A HREF='http://www.knot-theory.com'>Knot Theory</A>. He wasn't, so I let him live.).. Apparently he also runs <A HREF='http://www.coastersims.com'>CoasterSims</A>! 

OMG, a whole site of Coaster Sims. I was addicted as hell to (the very very first) Disney Coaster when it came out. I played the hell out of that on my 486. I picked up No Limit a couple of years ago, but wasn't horribly impressed for some reason or another. I'd totally forgotten about this stuff until tonight. Playtime!
