Was talking to the guy who's starting [yoyodb][1], a new yoyo trick linking site (Ok, so I was bullying him to make sure he wasn't doing an exact copy of [Knot Theory][2]. He wasn't, so I let him live.).. Apparently he also runs [CoasterSims][3]! 

OMG, a whole site of Coaster Sims. I was addicted as hell to (the very very first) Disney Coaster when it came out. I played the hell out of that on my 486. I picked up No Limit a couple of years ago, but wasn't horribly impressed for some reason or another. I'd totally forgotten about this stuff until tonight. Playtime!
