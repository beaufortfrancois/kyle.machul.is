Google has implemented currency conversion into their calculation engine. Not that you have to <A HREF='http://www.google.com/search?q=one+kilometer+per+rubles+seconds+squared+in+parsecs+per+baht+fortnight+years'>use it</A> for <A HREF='http://www.google.com/search?q=the+gravitational+constant+times+the+radius+of+pluto+divided+by+five+yen'>that</A>.

As a friend just said in IM, "Eventually, they're going to make it smart enough to just reply, 'That makes no damn sense.'"
