So I've added a DB backend to <A HREF='http://www.nonpolynomial.com/archives/2007/06/fwiktr_v01.php'>fwiktr</A>, and gave it the ability to reload automatically so you can sit there and stare.

<A HREF='http://www.30helensagree.com/fwiktr/fwiktr_view.php'>Here it is</A>

Trying to clean things up a little more so I can easily plug more post and picture sources, then back to the fun stuff ('cause I'd completely forgotten how much I hate PHP programming).

Some favorites so far:

<A HREF='http://www.30helensagree.com/fwiktr/fwiktr_view.php?art_refresh=0&art_index=3399'>LaTeX isn't cooperating. I know for a fact that my document is well-formed TeX.</A>
