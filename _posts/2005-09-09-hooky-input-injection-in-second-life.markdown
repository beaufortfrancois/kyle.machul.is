Second Life comes with 2 control mechanisms; keyboard and mouse. There's very little problem getting around in the world with these two methods. However, at Nonpolynomial Labs we believe that input can be as much part of the world as the client itself. Out of that idea grew <A HREF='http://www.nonpolynomial.com/content/2005/09/hooky_input_inj.php'>Hooky, an input injector for Second Life</A>.

Through Hooky, users can now control Second Life through any device that is compatible with DirectInput, and soon, any device that can be monitored through system hooks. Joysticks, foot pedals, and kitchen sinks are now all fair game for ways to experience and navigate through the world
