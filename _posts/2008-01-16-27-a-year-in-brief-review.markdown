Yup, it's that time again. As the year revolves around my birthday (and not January 1st, but god bless you all for getting close), it's time for me to do a retrospective of my year of being 27 (on the day before I cease being it), as seen through my public identity of aggregated 0's and 1's stored on servers around the world. It's my time to sit here and realize that I still have yet to make that great mathematical discovery, and I'm losing time quickly (it becomes impossible at age 30).

So, this year, I:

- Lived outside of Oklahoma for a full year for the first time, ever.
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/196134.html'>Open sourced a dance accidently.</A>
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/202910.html'>Perverted a web service and then turned it into furniture</A>
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/213423.html'>Slapped together generative art</A>
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/230049.html'>And then slapped together some more generative art</A>
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/220788.html'>And some hand followy lights</A>
- <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/231282.html'>And hooked a yoyo to a wiimote</A>
- <A HREF='http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2007/11/26/moaning-lisa/'>Helped build knob boobs</A>
- <A HREF='http://www.flickr.com/photos/qdot76367/sets/72157601249957353/'>Went to my first SIGGRAPH</A>
- <A HREF='http://www.monochrom.at/arse-elektronika/about.html'>Helped organize a conference after I explicitly said I'd never do that again</A>
- Started my first open source projects (versus just helping on them) (<A HREF='http://sourceforge.net/projects/libnifalcon'>libnifalcon</A>, <A HREF='http://sourceforge.net/projects/libtrancevibe'>libtrancevibe</A>, <A HREF='http://sourceforge.net/projects/liblightstone'>liblightstone</A>
- Learned two new languages (Python, Max)
- A bunch of other stuff I'm not documenting here, like awesome new people I met and all that.

Well. It was no <A HREF='http://qdot.livejournal.com/149780.html'>2005</A>, but it'll do.
