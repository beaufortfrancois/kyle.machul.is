[Second Life: Boredom I pay for by the month][3]

Originally uploaded by [qdot76367][4].

First off, this is my first cross flickr blogging shot, so if it's fuckered, sorry.  

I took the leap and started a Second Life Account last night. For anyone out there reading that plays or has friends who play, I'm **qDot Bunnyhug**. Have your people message me. I'm bored and I have no friends. Much like first life.  

So far, I've flown around, met some people, and visited a goth club not unlike the ones I go to around here. Except it was ONLINE. That's right, we've spent a few millenia advancing as a race, to the point where I can now sit bored in a goth club ON THE FUCKING INTERNET.   

I love technology. Love it so much.
