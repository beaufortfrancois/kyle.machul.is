I love checking out the search terms that bring up my personal sites. I get some of the oddest results, mainly due to the fact that the page content itself is pretty odd in the first place. 

Nonpolynomial.com - <i>second life virtual horse vehicle</i>

The Virtual Amish have found me, I guess.

mmorgy.com - <i>sluts on the streets</i>

As opposed to on the sidewalk. You never know what people are into.
