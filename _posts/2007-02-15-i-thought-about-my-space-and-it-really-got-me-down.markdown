In the interest of seeing what happens when I build my own usability interfaces, I put my daily development setup into a mindmap, documenting keystrokes required to get to things, number of sub-contexts each application forms (either fixed, range, range+ which means range is normal but can be more, or ? which means god only knows).   

This setup seems completely natural to me, but looking at it this way, it's interesting to see what could be changed and optimized to either be lower in the tree or accessed differently.
