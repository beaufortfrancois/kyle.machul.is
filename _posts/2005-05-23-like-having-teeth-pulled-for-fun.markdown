When trying to find someone to go to a show with you, it's generally good if their arn't reviews of the show floating around that describe it as "two guys behind laptops who act like the audience isn't there" or "like being kicked in the face for 2 hours while sitting in complete darkness". (All of these refering to the current Autechre tour)

For liking electronic music so much, the majority of the artists sure do put on shitty live shows. I really gotta stop buying tickets in advance.
