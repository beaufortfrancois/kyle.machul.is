[Behold, the Paddle Palace V-988 Table Tennis Robot][2].

For those of you not aware, I'm working on building my own table tennis bot right now (project documented [here][3]). I was doing some research on other bots out at the moment, and found this one, newly released this month.

Now, is it just me, or does the ball hopper look like a toilet? I mean, really, it looks like you'd poo, then run away as it threw your own poo back at you. Strangely artistic in some sort of dadaist way.
