It all started on January 02, 1996. I found a small text file on how
to make webpages, and had played with Paint Shop Pro (PSP) before.
Since it was Christmas break and I had nothing better to do, I made a
homepage. Using a Cure CD (Pornography, I think it was) to generate
some images with
[Cthugha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthugha_%28software%29), I then
pasted them into PSP and just wrote stuff over them in a "gothic"
font. I did the same thing with the background, and all of the other 2
or 3 graphics I put on the page. Since I was into the whole gothy
thing (i.e. I owned albums released on the Cleopatra label), I decided
to make a little Gothic page. It contained a few pictures of myself
and links to the bands I liked.

Yes, my first webpage in 1996 webpage was mostly generative art. Also,
drippy blood bars.
