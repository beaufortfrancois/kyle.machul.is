title: Trettio Lighting System
slug: trettio-lighting-system
template: project

An arduino based system for controlling a set of Ikea Trettio
lights. These lights use tamiya style connectors, and take 12v
power. Power is routed from a small computer power supply to the
lights, with levels controlled through MOSFETs via PWM signals from
the arduino. Programs on other devices can then access the arduino via
the network to set light levels.
