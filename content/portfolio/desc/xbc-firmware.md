template: project

Firmware for the Xport Botball Controller, built to load and run
programs written in the Interactive C language. The firmware acted as
a virtual machine to execute IC bytecode, as well as route information
from sensors and to motors in order to work as a full fledged robotics
system. It also contained calibration systems for the XBC camera,
which provided real time color blob tracking for multiple colors.
