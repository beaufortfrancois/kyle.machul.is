Deldo is a sex toy control and teledildonics mode for emacs. Using a
combination of elisp for internal control and python for hardware
access, it allows emacs users to tie their everyday usage of the
program into haptic feedback capabilities. As many emacs users live
solely in the emacs environment, it's only fitting that they be
capable of mating with/via it.
