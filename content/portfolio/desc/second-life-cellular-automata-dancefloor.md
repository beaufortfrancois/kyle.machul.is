The idea of a dancefloor that runs something like
[Conway's Game Of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
seems like a simple idea to implement. However, due to the limitations
of Second Life in 2005, putting together a 96x96 grid took a massive
amount of work both inside Second Life and on outside servers.
