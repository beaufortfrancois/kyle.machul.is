Reverse engineered driver for the Lightstone biometrics hardware. The
Lightstone came with a piece of software called Journey to Wild
Divine, a game which aimed to teach users how to relax and meditate.
It recorded blood oxygen and galvanic skin response (GSR), using these
metrics to derive pulse and relaxation levels.
