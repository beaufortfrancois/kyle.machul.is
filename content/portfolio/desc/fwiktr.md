Fwiktr is an application meant to feed digital picture frames with a
constant stream of random images with seemingly related contextual
captions. It consists of a set of python scripts that given a message
on twitter, will extract certain key parts of speech, and use that
information to search for a image on flickr. It then overlays the
tweet on the picture in an "interesting" way.
