Force Feedback Reality is a small circuit made to turn analog signals
from different sensors into haptic force feedback events. Using an
ATTiny13 and a variety of sensors, the board allows the user to
augment other senses into touch. For instance, the vibration motor
will speed up as more light is cast on a photoresistor. For
modularity, the sensors can be switched out quickly using the mono
3.5cm jack.
