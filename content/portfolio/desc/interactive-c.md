Compiler and IDE for the Interactive C language. Interactive C is a
bytecode interpreted languages for small scale educational robotics,
used by high school and college students to make programming embedded
platforms easier and more intuitive. Allows for the structure of C
while also removing some common foot guns (has bounded arrays, no
pointer arithmetic, etc...). Code can be directly injected into the
bot to run interactively in order to trace sensor values and test
motor setups.
