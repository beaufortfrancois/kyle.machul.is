Max/MSP patch that generates "Breakcore" style music using messages
from the Twitter Microblogging Service. The patch pulls a message from
the twitter public timeline, uses summed ASCII values per word to
choose a place to loop in the sample, and then plays the loop while
using Text To Speech to broadcast the twitter message. Loop ad naseum.
