template: project

A project for the show [Proving Ground on G4 Television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_Ground_%28TV_series%29).
Used in the Star Wars episode. Gestures made by people in front of the
kinect would trigger different physical objects being thrown at an
actor, in order to simulate "force" powers. This required software to
make the kinect trigger a computer controlled power strip as each
gesture was made, turning on mains voltage to different machines.
