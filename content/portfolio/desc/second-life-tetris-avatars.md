title: Second Life Tetris Avatars
slug: second-life-tetris-avatars
template: project

Made for a presentation given at the GDX conference at SCAD, these
tetris avatars were used to show how to build a minimal business
around portfolio pieces in Second Life. The Tetris Avatars consisted
of only one or two primitive shapes, and only one texture. A script
allowed the owner to change the color, or rotate the piece.

Avatars were priced according to the desirability of the piece,
meaning the long straight piece was the most expensive, while the s/z
pieces cost less.

These avatars were used in a presentation that outlined the basics of
building a business in Second Life, and was presented to art and
design students at SCAD as an alternative way to build and show work
in an online world.
