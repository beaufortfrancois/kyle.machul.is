Oh, what a crazy month it has been.

The Microsoft Kinect camera came out on Nov. 4th, and has eaten a good
portion of my month, in a good way. Work with the
[OpenKinect Community][1] has been one of the best open source project
experiences I've ever had. I'm the lead code integrator on the
project, as well as doing some platform support. Haven't had a lot of
time to work on my own kinect projects, but it's been fun to watch
what comes out of the libraries. The code repo is available on the
[OpenKinect Organization Github Site][2].

In terms of press around the kinect project, I did
[an interview with New Scientist Magazine][3] as well as a talk at
DorkbotSF. Video of the talk (audio is horrible, but I might redo it
later) is available in 3 parts:

* [Part 1][4] 
* [Part 2][5] 
* [Part 3][6]

A few weeks ago, I got pretty dire food poisoning. I eventually felt
better, and for some reason ended up with [an emacs jerkcity mode][13]
too. I'm not sure how these things happen.

For a quick rundown on maintenance of other projects and interesting
news:

* [libnifalcon][7] got a v1.0.2 release, mainly to fix very nasty
  build system issues. 
* On that note, I'm taking a step back and re-evaluating what
  [compily_buildd][8] really needs to do, as it at some point got WAY
  overcomplicated and is making my code exceedingly difficult for
  others to build.
* Looks like someone has started up
  [a project to reverse engineer the Phantom Omni haptic device][9]
* [np_mindset][14] seems to have a pretty major bug in the binary
  release. Going to try to get this fixed and out ASAP.
