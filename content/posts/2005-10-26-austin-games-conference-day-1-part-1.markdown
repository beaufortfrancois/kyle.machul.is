This is the way the conference begins.

This is the way the conference begins.

This is the way the conference begins.

Not with a bang,

but with 2 hours sleep.

What was going to be 2 hours of blog updates on the morning's game writer's conference lectures (including one by a writier on HALF LIFE) now sees me sitting a mile away from the conference center, with 30 minutes to get lunch and get back to cover the Women's Games Conference.

While wearing boots. 

I'm not taking off the boots. They're too damn sexy.

More later.
