title: Website Reboot and np_mindset Release
date: 2010-10-04 23:02:20


After 10 months of silence, it's time to get things moving on here
again. First off, I've created
[a new website for all of my Max/MSP and PureData externals][1]. After
5 years of creating externals and having people find them randomly, it
seemed like a good time to start advertising them like an actual
developer.

[np_mindset version 1.1.5 released][2]

I've also been getting a few requests for my Neurosky external lately,
which I never actually finished after the biometric presentation
project last year. So, I've tightened it up, released one non-working
version, and have now released one slightly less non-working (or more
working) version! Version 1.1.5 should allow you to reliably pull data
from the mindset using Max/MSP, though the CPU usage is still on the
high side, and it still crashes horribly on PureData. There will be a
version 1.2 release that addresses these issues soon, but this should
work for the time being.
