title: Conference and Moving Updates
date: 2006-06-06 00:46:32 

Well, it's been far, far too long since I've updated this, so, here goes.

  * I will unfortunately not be at the [Sex in Video Games Conference][1] due to conflicts with moving.
  * Speaking of which, I'm moving to San Francisco, to work at [Linden Lab][2], the [Second Life][3] people.
  * I'll still be speaking at [The European Women in Games Conference][4]
  * I'll also now be at the [Second Life Community Convention][5], too.

That's it for now. Back to packing.
