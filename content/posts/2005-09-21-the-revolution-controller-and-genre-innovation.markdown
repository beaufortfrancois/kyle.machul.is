[The Revolution Controller and Genre Innovation][2]

I was ready to make a nice, long winded post on why I think Nintendo's new Revolution controller is going to changing gaming forever, bring peace to the world, end hunger, and give everyone a puppy. However, this post on Lost Garden does it a lot better than I ever could (and is a little more even handed, too).
