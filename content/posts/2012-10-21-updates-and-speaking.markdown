Time for more speaking updates!

I'll be part of a panel on
[using biometrics for generative game audio at AES][1], on Friday,
October 26th, at 2pm. Should be fun!

Also, I've just moved a lot of the health driver projects I currently
maintain to the [OpenYou organization on github][2]. The hope is to
get more developers working on these projects, versus having the world
waiting on me to have time to work on things. There's more information
available at [the post on openyou.org][3].
