At Yuri's Night this year, [CreateDigitalMusic.com][1] had a futuristic music design competition to see what new an innovative audio interfaces people could come up with. I filmed the competition, and have finally gotten everything edited and up on YouTube. I apologize in advance for the Blair Witch-esque camera work. :)
