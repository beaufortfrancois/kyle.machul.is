[Sports training equipment using haptic feedback][2]

A new sports training device has been developed that uses haptic feedback for communication of movement and adjustment. Instead of using touch to signify where an athlete should move or bend, it allows coaches and trainers to remotely contact them while they are performing. This enhances the ability of trainers to communicate easily and athletes to understand what needs happen to improve performance.
