title: Falcon Uncasing
date: 2008-06-07 23:25:22 

Well, after two months of not getting much done I finally manage to zip a directory and call it v0.4 of [libnifalcon][1], and the developer responsible for the [SolidEdge simulation][2] [does a full uncasing of the Falcon, taking a great picture set along the way][3]. I'm start to feel like I'm falling a bit behind in usefulness here. :)

I really like this image for some reason.
