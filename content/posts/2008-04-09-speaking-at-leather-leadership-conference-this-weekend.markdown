Yup, it took all of a month for my "no new speaking until I have something new to say" thing to fall apart. But, well, this is different! Really! Somehow. :)

So yeah, I'm now part of the BDSM and Web 2.0 panel at [the 12th Annual Leather Leadership Conference][2]. The panel takes place Sunday, April 13th, at 10:30am. The panel will include Thomas Roche (who I was also on a panel with at Arse Elektronika, now of [kink.com][3]), Richard Hunter (of [Mr. S Leather][4]), Steve Bower (Webmaster for the [Society of Janus][5]), and others. Should be fun!
