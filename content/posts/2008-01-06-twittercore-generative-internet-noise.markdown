The week of getting half-done projects to 3/4th done continues.

I created this back in September, when I was taking my Max/MSP classes at [RobotSpeak][4]. I decided to try layering [twitter][5] public timeline messages run through text-to-speech over fairly simple looped break samples, because noise + noise = noise.

Unfortunately, either Py/Ext or flite~ is causing Max/MSP to crash about 20-30 minutes in, regularly, so having a full time stream running is a bit of an issue right now. However, I made a small 2.5 minute track.
