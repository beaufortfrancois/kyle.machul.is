[G-Link][2] is a device that maps the habits of a player onto their character in a game. By recording the actions and environments experienced by the player throughout the day (distance walked, amount of speaking, metrics of inhabited environments), the device maps the gathered statistics to the players avatar in the game world. If the player is inactive, then the in-game character will be physically weaker. Likewise, light levels around the player will effect their alignment in the game.
