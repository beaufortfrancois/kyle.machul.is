date: 2015-09-19 17:58:10

I was an Artist In Residence at
[Autodesk Pier 9](http://autodesk.com/pier9) from July 2014 to January
2015, concentrating on a sound art project to extract new and
interesting sounds from the prototyping machines around the workshop.
There's a video of the lecture I gave covering my time at Pier 9:

[OpenTranscripts was also nice enough to provide a transcription of the talk](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/words-sounds-pier-9/).
The project was covered by media outlets such as
[CNet](http://www.cnet.com/news/the-strange-surprising-sounds-of-3d-printers-waterjets-and-laser-cutters/)
and [re/code](http://recode.net/2015/01/24/bees-were-the-original-3-d-printers-autodesk-has-its-first-art-show/).
