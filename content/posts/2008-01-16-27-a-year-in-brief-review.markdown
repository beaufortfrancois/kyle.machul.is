title: "27: A year in brief review"
date: 2008-01-16 23:12:26

Yup, it's that time again. As the year revolves around my birthday (and not January 1st, but god bless you all for getting close), it's time for me to do a retrospective of my year of being 27 (on the day before I cease being it), as seen through my public identity of aggregated 0's and 1's stored on servers around the world. It's my time to sit here and realize that I still have yet to make that great mathematical discovery, and I'm losing time quickly (it becomes impossible at age 30).

So, this year, I:

- Lived outside of Oklahoma for a full year for the first time, ever.

- [Open sourced a dance accidently.][1]

- [Perverted a web service and then turned it into furniture][2]

- [Slapped together generative art][3]

- [And then slapped together some more generative art][4]

- [And some hand followy lights][5]

- [And hooked a yoyo to a wiimote][6]

- [Helped build knob boobs][7]

- [Went to my first SIGGRAPH][8]

- [Helped organize a conference after I explicitly said I'd never do that again][9]

- Started my first open source projects (versus just helping on them) ([libnifalcon][10], [libtrancevibe][11], [liblightstone][12]

- Learned two new languages (Python, Max)

- A bunch of other stuff I'm not documenting here, like awesome new people I met and all that.

Well. It was no [2005][13], but it'll do.
