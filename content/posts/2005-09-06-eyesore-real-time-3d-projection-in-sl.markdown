[EyeSore: Real Time 3D Projection with Second Life][2] provides SL users with a 3D visualization of the virtual world. Using two SL accounts and a polarized projection system, users can fly through the world, seeing the spectacular, larger than (real) life builds in full 3D. In this article, we outline the vision theory behind the project, as well as showing how the system was constructed.
