In sumation:  

* Jesus is here. Therefore it's a good conference.  
* Tony Walsh has no hair. His picture? It lies. (Will have photographic proof of this tomorrow)  
* Open Bars are God's gift to man  
* Free Food and Open Bars AT THE SAME TIME is like God giving his gift to man like, a bunch.  
* The Hotel fucking R00LZ. More pictures of that tomorrow. Poepli will probably blog too.
