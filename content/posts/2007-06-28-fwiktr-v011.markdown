title: Fwiktr v0.1.1
date: 2007-06-28 00:49:04 

So I've added a DB backend to [fwiktr][1], and gave it the ability to reload automatically so you can sit there and stare.

[Here it is][2]

Trying to clean things up a little more so I can easily plug more post and picture sources, then back to the fun stuff ('cause I'd completely forgotten how much I hate PHP programming).

Some favorites so far:

[freakin underwear keeps riding up ugh][3]

[LaTeX isn't cooperating. I know for a fact that my document is well-formed TeX.][4]

[At KABUTO-CHO .][5]

[resisting sleep for no good reason.][6]

[I was a math teacher, and my counting is impeccable. http://sciencehack.com/videos/view/HJPKrcnXRRc][7] - [Wow, and I found this neat video from this one][8]

[Back to the Java Forums][9]
