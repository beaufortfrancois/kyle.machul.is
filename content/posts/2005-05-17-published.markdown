Yay! Academic legitimacy is mine! ALL MINE!

I got a paper on Lunar Rover Telecommunication published at [iSAIRAS][1], and a paper on the XBC (the XBC is the gameboy robot we'll soon be selling at KIPR) published at [IROS][2]! 

Yaaaaay!

I think this may very well drive my [Erdos number][3] under infinity!
