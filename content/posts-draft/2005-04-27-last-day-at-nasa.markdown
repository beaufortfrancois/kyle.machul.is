Never have I been so ready to go back to Oklahoma as I am right now. Braums, hot sex0rz, and severe lack of Mars Drills await.

But man, am I ever gonna miss working in a place that has so many building with so many GIGANTIC TUBES coming out of them. Really, this place (NASA Ames Research Center) must be like the disneyland of GIGANTIC TUBE buildings. 

More on the trip once I regain brain power enough to write something entertaining.
