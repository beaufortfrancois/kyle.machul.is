<p>Second Life (SL) is an amazing virtual world, capable of letting its
users produce beautiful, gigantic 3D structures. However, most users
are stuck with a 2D screen to view these on, making them lose their
depth and graduer. The EyeSore project (So named for the headaches it
can cause when the system falls out of sync, not to mention the fact
that there is a large portion of builds in SL that could easily be
described as such) allows a user to navigate through the world using
the view points of two avatars, combined using a polarized projection
system onto a metalic reflective screen. Through the use of polarized
glasses and the vision capabilities of the human brain, the images
produced by the two viewpoints of the avatars are combined to create a
3D picture.

The system for this project was originally built for the <a href="http://www.deathbots.com/gallery/AmboyCrater">Copernicus Rover Mission</a> at Amboy Crater in May of 2004. It was used as a Lunar
Rover view simulator for study of user interface and driver fatigue
conditions for space missions.
