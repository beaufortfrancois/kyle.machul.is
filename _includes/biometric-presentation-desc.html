<p>Max/MSP patch used during presentation to show the biometrics of the
presenter to the audience. The presenter wears devices that read pulse
rate and brain activity, which is then displayed behind the presenter
along with their slides. This gives the audience an intimate view of
the presenter's internal state, regardless of how calm and collected
they may seem outwardly.
